Some MadParts electronic part footprint definitions for EDA e.g. KiCad, Eagle.

Also known as lands or library symbols.  Mostly SMD footprints.

Provided as-is, you should check them yourselves.

MadParts is a great way of defining footprints.  The language is compact and parametric or declarative rather than procedural.  If you don’t like the GUI symbol editor’s in KiCad, try MadParts.  You type parameters in a ‘program’ in one window, and immediately see the footprint in another window.
